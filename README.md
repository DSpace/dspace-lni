# DSpace Lightweight Network Interface (LNI)
This is a mothballed copy of the dspace-lni module as at 18 August 2015. 

LNI Documentation: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/LightweightNetworkInterface

It had previously been agreed that this module would be decommissioned for DSpace version 6.0 (and above). The 6.0 [DSpace Services API](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Service+based+api) refactor meant that this change became more urgent. This copy is available to allow any interested parties to renintegrate this module into their local DSpace if they so wish.

Many thanks to all those who contributed to this module over the years!
